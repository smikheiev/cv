  "aboutMe": "I’m a product-minded software engineer with over 10 years of experience across multiple industries and technology stacks. I focus on understanding user problems and pain points and solving them with code. I collaborate closely with product managers, designers, and other stakeholders to ensure technical solutions align with business goals and deliver a great user experience. I am a fast learner, quickly adapting to new technologies and challenges.\nI have experience working across all parts of the product - from frontend and backend to infrastructure. I also enjoy improving the developer experience to make developers' lives easier and more efficient. And to some extent, I like working on team processes to improve productivity and collaboration.",

      "description": "This role marked a significant shift, both in terms of industry – moving away from gamedev – and the technologies I worked with. I quickly adapted to new tools such as React, React Native, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, and later, Google Cloud Platform and Terraform. I was able to contribute to the codebase immediately and quickly became an integral part of the team. I worked on the mobile application for users, the internal web dashboard for therapists, backend services, and cloud infrastructure.\nAs a tech lead, I was responsible for technical decisions, ensuring code quality and architecture met company standards, guiding the team on best practices, mentoring and onboarding team members. I was also accountable for the reliability and stability of services, ensuring they ran smoothly and efficiently. As part of the product trio (Product Manager, Lead Designer, and Tech Lead), we worked together to shape the product’s future, review user research and product analytics, adjust the roadmap, and prioritize features to ensure the product met both user needs and business objectives.",

I also helped with managing project timelines and allocating resources. I worked closely with game producers, managers, and other teams (backend, platform) to ensure timely game releases.\nAdditionally, I contributed to improving the company’s internal framework, introducing new features and supporting its transition from a monolithic structure to smaller, independent modules.",

      "description": "I worked on the web client for a real-time online multiplayer billiards game using ActionScript (Flash). I applied my knowledge of ActionScript and the Starling framework and gained new skills, particularly in implementing MVC architecture with the Robotlegs framework, using IoC, and the TweenMax library for animations. This project also introduced me to working in a larger team and following agile methodologies and good development practices (e.g., code reviews, CI/CD).\nLater, I transitioned to mobile development, working on an Android client for a real-time multiplayer poker game built with Java (native Android app). Although I was new to native Android development, I quickly adapted and began contributing within the first week. Later, I worked on porting the game to the Qt framework for both iOS and Android platforms, which required learning Qt and C++. Through this, I gained experience in native Android (and some iOS) development, the Qt environment, and mobile development practices (e.g., app release and distribution process).\nAs a senior software engineer, I later led a team of three developers on a new project: a real-time multiplayer strategy card game for Android and iOS. We used the Qt framework for the client and C++ for the backend game logic. The game was successfully soft-launched on the Apple and Google app stores.",

      "description": "I was hired as a Unity3D developer, but shortly after starting, I was asked to help with a small game built with ActionScript (Flash). Following this, I took on the development of a major project as the sole developer on the team: an online match-3 game, similar to Candy Crush Saga, which was launched on the Facebook Games platform. Although I had only basic knowledge of ActionScript initially, I quickly learned key frameworks and libraries used in game development (e.g., Starling, Spine). Working on this project taught me both good and bad coding practices and how to handle the unique challenges of maintaining and updating a live game. It gave me a strong foundation for future development.\nIn addition to this large project, I contributed to several smaller games developed with ActionScript and Unity3D. This role also provided my first experience in a collaborative team environment, where I worked closely with PMs, designers, and other stakeholders.",
