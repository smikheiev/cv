I quickly learned and adapted to new tools such as React, React Native, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, and later Google Cloud Platform and Terraform. I was able to contribute to the codebase from the start and quickly became an integral part of the team. I worked on the mobile application for users, the internal web dashboard for therapists, backend services, and cloud infrastructure.\nAs a tech lead, I was responsible for technical decisions, ensuring that code quality and architecture met company standards, guiding the team on best practices, mentoring and onboarding team members. I was also the go-to person for any technical challenges or questions from other teams. Additionally, I was accountable for the reliability and stability of the services, ensuring they ran smoothly and efficiently with minimal downtime. As part of the product trio (Product Manager, Lead Designer, and Tech Lead), we worked together to shape the product’s future, review user research and product analytics, adjust the roadmap, and prioritize features to ensure the product met both user needs and business objectives.\nTechnologies used: React, React Native, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Google Cloud Platform, Terraform."

I applied my knowledge of ActionScript and the Starling framework and gained new skills, particularly in implementing MVC architecture with the Robotlegs framework, using IoC, and the TweenMax library for animations. This project also introduced me to working in a larger team and following agile methodologies and good development practices (eg, code reviews, CI/CD).\nLater, I transitioned to mobile development, working on an Android client for a real-time multiplayer poker game built with Java (native Android app). Although I was new to native Android development, I quickly got up to speed and began contributing within the first week. I then worked on porting the game to the Qt framework for both iOS and Android platforms, which required learning the Qt framework and C++. Through this, I gained experience in native Android (and a bit iOS) development, the Qt environment, and mobile development practices (eg, app release and distribution process).\nAs a senior software engineer, I later led a team of 3 developers on a new project: a real-time multiplayer strategy card game for Android and iOS. We used the Qt framework for the client and C++ for the backend game logic. The game was successfully soft-launched on the Apple and Google app stores.\nTechnologies used: ActionScript (Flash), Starling framework, Robotlegs framework (MVC), TweenMax, native Android, Java, Qt, C++."

Following this, I took on the development of a major project as the sole developer on the team: an online match-3 game, similar to Candy Crush Saga, which was launched on the Facebook Games platform. Although I had only basic knowledge of ActionScript initially, I quickly learned key frameworks and libraries used in game development (eg, Starling, Spine). Working on this project taught me both good and bad coding practices, as well as how to handle the unique challenges of maintaining and updating a live game. It gave me a strong foundation for my future development.\nIn addition to this large project, I contributed to several smaller games developed with ActionScript and Unity3D. This role also provided my first experience in a collaborative team environment, where I worked closely with PMs, designers, and other stakeholders.\nTechnologies used: ActionScript (Flash), Unity3D, Starling framework (game engine), Spine (skeletal animations)."
